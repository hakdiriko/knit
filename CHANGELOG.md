# Changelog

## 0.1.1 (test: Sync)

- New **Sync** switch under Size (off by default, so existing sets sound the same). When it's on, the Echo, Shift and Memory delay times snap to the note value nearest to where Size puts them at the host tempo: straight, dotted or triplet, from 1/64 to a whole note. Size still means small to large; Sync rounds it to the grid.
- The Resonator stays free, so it keeps its pitch.
- Memory grains replay moments one to four quarters of their reach back, so replays land on the grid too.
- Delay times still glide, so stepping Size from one note value to the next bends the pitch like tape, and tempo changes follow smoothly.
- The switch shows the Echo node's note value (for example "Sync: 1/8 dotted"), or "no tempo" when the host doesn't send one; viber then stays free.
- The window is 30 px taller to fit the switch.

## 0.1.0 (Phase 1: the network)

- viber now makes sound: four nodes (**Echo**, **Resonator**, **Shift**, **Memory**) that feed each other through a coupling matrix.
  - Echo: a clean-ish delay with tape glide (turning Size bends the pitch of what's already echoing).
  - Resonator: a short, high-feedback delay that rings at a pitch (about 520 Hz at small Size down to 65 Hz at large).
  - Shift: an octave-up and an octave-down delay; Tone balances them, so bright spirals up (shimmer) and dark spirals down.
  - Memory: four overlapping grains replaying random moments from the last 0.2 to 2.6 seconds.
- Knobs: **Ecology** (colour → space → ringing → life), **Size**, **Tone**, **Mix** (equal power) and **Output** (trim, ±12 dB).
- Full safety chain: saturator and DC blocker inside every loop, wet auto-gain (±12 dB), a −0.3 dBFS safety limiter, a NaN/Inf guard, and a click-free bypass crossfade.
- Above about 75% Ecology the network sustains itself. It feeds on the input: once the input has been silent for a while, the drone fades out on its own.
- Generic window: five knobs with live values (Ecology names its regime), hover hints, double-click to reset.
- Defaults (Ecology 42%, Size 50%, Tone 55%, Mix 40%) already put the sound in a room.

## 0.0.1 (Phase 0: foundation)

- First build of **viber**: a stereo (or mono) passthrough with a placeholder window showing the name and version. It does not change the sound yet.
- CMake/JUCE 8 project producing VST3 on Windows and macOS, plus AU on macOS.
- CI builds Windows, macOS and Linux on every push, runs pluginval at strictness 10 (and `auval` for the AU), and uploads the plug-ins as downloadable artifacts.
- The discovery audit runs on the Linux build in CI and fails the build on any FAIL.
- Docs moved into the repo: `docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, `docs/DSP_PLAYBOOK.md`, `tools/discovery_audit.py`.
- Audit fix: the percussive test signal peaked at +4.3 dBFS, so even an untouched passthrough was flagged as BLOWUP. It is now normalized to a −6 dBFS peak.
